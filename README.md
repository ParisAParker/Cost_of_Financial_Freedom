Most people want the freedom to shop, travel, and do the things they love, but don't have the money to do it. A major obstacle stopping people from achieving this freedom is the cost of living. By analyzing the cost of living and income changes, we can understand how the value of our money has changed.

### Motivation
There are many people who say living is unafforable for the new generation, but how much truth is in that claim. Of course it is known that housing prices appreciate, gas prices fluctuate, and the price of groceries increase, but does the data support that the cost is getting unafforable? To answer this question, this project will investigate the historic changes in price and income.

### Data Questions
- At what rate has the cost of living increased?
- At what rate has income increased?
- Is the value of our money always decreasing. If so, at what rate?
